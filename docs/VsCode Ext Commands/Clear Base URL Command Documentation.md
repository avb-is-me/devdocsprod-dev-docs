## What does this command do?

This command clears the value of the `baseUrl` key stored in the Visual Studio Code extension's storage manager. It is an asynchronous function that sets the value of `baseUrl` to `null`.

## Why should I use this command?

You might want to use this command if you need to reset or clear the base URL value that the extension is using. This could be useful if the previously set base URL is no longer valid or if you want to start fresh with a new base URL.

## What are the relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?

This specific code snippet does not interact with any configuration options from the `dev-docs.json` file directly. However, the extension might have other configuration options related to the base URL, such as a default base URL or a way to specify a custom base URL.

## Example JSON of relevant Dev-Docs.json options

Since this code snippet does not interact with any configuration options, there is no relevant example JSON to provide.

## Prerequisites

To use this command, you need to have the Visual Studio Code extension installed and running. Additionally, the extension should have a storage manager system in place to store and retrieve configuration values like the base URL.

## How do I use this command?

To use this command, you need to invoke the asynchronous function from within the extension's code. This might be triggered by a user action, such as clicking a button or running a command, or it could be invoked as part of another process within the extension.

The command clears the `baseUrl` value stored in the storage manager, effectively resetting the base URL used by the extension. After running this command, the extension might prompt the user to enter a new base URL or use a default value.

It's important to note that without additional context from the extension's codebase, it's difficult to provide more specific details on how and when this command should be used, or what the implications of clearing the base URL might be.
