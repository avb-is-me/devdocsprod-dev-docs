## What does this VS Code Extension Command do?

The `devdocs.askDocs` command is a feature of the VS Code extension that allows developers to ask questions about their codebase and receive answers based on the project's documentation and context. When triggered, it prompts the user to enter a question related to their codebase. The extension then processes the question, retrieves relevant information from the project's documentation, and provides an answer to the user.

## Why should I use this VS Code Extension Command?

This command can be useful in several scenarios:

1. **Quick Reference**: Instead of manually searching through documentation or code, developers can quickly obtain information by asking natural language questions.
2. **Context-aware Answers**: The answers are generated based on the project's specific documentation and code context, ensuring relevance to the current codebase.
3. **Time-saving**: Quickly finding answers without sifting through extensive documentation can save developers valuable time.
4. **Accessibility**: Developers can easily access information without leaving their coding environment.

## What are relevant configuration Options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The `dev-docs.json` file likely contains configuration options related to the Dev Docs extension, such as:

- `devdocs_id_token`: An authentication token required to access the Dev Docs service.
- `default_org`: The default organization or repository to use for querying documentation.
- `devdocs_refresh_token`: A refresh token used to obtain new access tokens when the current token expires.

## Example JSON of relevant Dev-Docs.json options

```json
{
  "devdocs_id_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "default_org": "myorganization/myproject",
  "devdocs_refresh_token": "XxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx..."
}
```

## Prerequisites

To use the `devdocs.askDocs` command, the following prerequisites must be met:

1. The Dev Docs VS Code extension must be installed and configured correctly.
2. The project's documentation must be available and accessible to the extension.
3. The necessary authentication tokens and configurations must be set up in the `dev-docs.json` file.

## How do I use this VS Code Extension Command?

To use the `devdocs.askDocs` command, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Press the designated keyboard shortcut or navigate to the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and search for "Dev Docs: Ask a Question".
3. Enter your question related to the codebase when prompted.
4. Wait for the extension to process the question and retrieve relevant information from the project's documentation.
5. The answer will be displayed in an information message within VS Code.

The extension leverages natural language processing and the project's documentation to provide contextual answers to your questions. This can significantly improve productivity by allowing you to quickly access relevant information without leaving your coding environment.
