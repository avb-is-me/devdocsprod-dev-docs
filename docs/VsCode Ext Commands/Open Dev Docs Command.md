## What does this VS Code Extension Command do?

This command is responsible for displaying a quick pick menu that prompts the user to choose whether to open the dev docs sidebar or not. The options available are "yes" and "no". Based on the user's selection, the corresponding value ("yes" or "no") is stored in the storage manager for the "sidebar" key.

## Why should I use this VS Code Extension Command?

This command provides a convenient way for users to quickly toggle the visibility of the dev docs sidebar within the VS Code editor. By selecting "yes," users can easily access the dev docs sidebar, which likely contains helpful documentation, resources, or tools related to the project or codebase they are working on. Alternatively, selecting "no" allows users to hide the sidebar, providing more screen real estate for coding if they don't need the dev docs at the moment.

## What are relevant configuration Options in the `dev-docs.json`?

Since the provided code snippet does not directly interact with the `dev-docs.json` file, there are no specific configuration options relevant to this command. However, it's possible that the `dev-docs.json` file may contain settings related to the behavior or appearance of the dev docs sidebar itself, such as the initial state (open or closed), sidebar width, or other customization options.

## Example JSON of relevant Dev-Docs.json options

As mentioned earlier, there are no specific configuration options directly relevant to this command. However, if the `dev-docs.json` file contains settings for the dev docs sidebar, it might include options similar to the following:

```json
{
  "devDocs": {
    "initialState": "open", // or "closed"
    "sidebarWidth": 300, // in pixels
    "theme": "light" // or "dark"
  }
}
```

## Prerequisites

To use this command, the following prerequisites must be met:

1. The VS Code extension that provides this command must be installed and enabled in the user's VS Code instance.
2. The user must have the necessary permissions to modify the storage manager values (typically granted by default).

## How do I use this VS Code Extension Command?

To use this command, follow these steps:

1. Open the VS Code editor with the project or codebase where the extension is installed.
2. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS).
3. Type "Open Dev Docs" or the name of the command provided by the extension and press Enter.
4. A quick pick menu will appear with the options "yes" and "no".
5. Select "yes" to open the dev docs sidebar or "no" to keep it closed.

The selected value will be stored in the storage manager for the "sidebar" key, and the dev docs sidebar will be displayed or hidden accordingly.
