## What does this VS Code Extension Command do?

This command is responsible for opening the Dev Docs application, which is a web-based tool for documenting codebases. It performs the following tasks:

1. Clears the 'draft' value from the storage manager.
2. Retrieves the 'devdocs_id_token' value from the storage manager.
3. Opens the Dev Docs application in a new window or tab, with the context of where the command was executed (in this case, from a file).

## Why should I use this VS Code Extension Command?

This command provides a convenient way to launch the Dev Docs application directly from within Visual Studio Code. By integrating Dev Docs into the code editor, developers can easily access and update documentation for their codebase without leaving their development environment. This streamlines the process of documenting code and encourages developers to keep documentation up-to-date.

## What are relevant configuration Options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The provided code snippet does not reference any specific configuration options from the `dev-docs.json` file. However, it's likely that this extension relies on configuration options related to authentication, such as the GitHub token used for authentication (`devdocs_id_token`).

## Example JSON of relevant Dev-Docs.json options

Since the provided code snippet does not reference any specific configuration options, an example JSON is not applicable in this case.

## Prerequisites

To use this VS Code Extension Command, you must have the following prerequisites:

1. The Dev Docs extension installed and configured in Visual Studio Code.
2. A valid authentication token (`devdocs_id_token`) stored in the storage manager, typically obtained through a GitHub authentication flow.

## How do I use this VS Code Extension Command?

To use this VS Code Extension Command, follow these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the file or directory where you want to document your codebase.
2. From the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`), search for and select the "Open Dev Docs" command.
3. The Dev Docs application will open in a new window or tab, with the context set to the file or directory from which you executed the command.
4. Within the Dev Docs application, you can create, edit, or view documentation for your codebase.

By executing this command, you can seamlessly transition from coding to documenting without leaving your development environment, making it easier to keep your documentation up-to-date and aligned with your codebase.
