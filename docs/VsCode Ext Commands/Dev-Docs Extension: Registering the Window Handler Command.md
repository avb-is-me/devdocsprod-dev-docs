## What does this command do?

This command registers a function called `WindowHandler` as a handler for the `devdocs.getWindowHandler` command in Visual Studio Code. The `WindowHandler` function is an asynchronous function that serves as the entry point for various operations related to the Dev-Docs extension.

## Why should I use this command?

This command is essential for the proper functioning of the Dev-Docs extension in Visual Studio Code. It sets up the communication channel between the extension and the Dev-Docs server or local development environment. Without registering this command, the extension would not be able to perform operations such as fetching documentation, saving changes, handling images, and executing version control operations.

## What are the relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The `dev-docs.json` file can contain various configuration options that affect the behavior of the Dev-Docs extension. Some relevant options include:

- `external`: Specifies whether the documentation files are stored outside the workspace or not.
- `customRoot`: Defines a custom root directory for the documentation files relative to the workspace.
- `workspaceRoot`: Determines whether the documentation files should be located within the workspace root directory.
- `api`: Contains information about the API documentation, such as the name, base URL, and Postman collection items.

## Example JSON of relevant `dev-docs.json` options

```json
{
  "external": true,
  "customRoot": "docs",
  "api": {
    "name": "My API",
    "baseUrl": "https://api.example.com"
  }
}
```

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code must be installed.
- The Dev-Docs extension must be installed and activated in Visual Studio Code.
- A workspace or project folder must be open in Visual Studio Code.

## How do I use this command?

You don't need to manually invoke this command. When you open a workspace or project folder containing the Dev-Docs extension, Visual Studio Code automatically registers the `devdocs.getWindowHandler` command and sets up the necessary communication channel.

However, if you need to interact with the Dev-Docs extension programmatically, you can use the `vscode.commands.executeCommand('devdocs.getWindowHandler')` API to trigger the `WindowHandler` function and perform various operations based on the provided command and options.
