## What does this code do?
This code defines an async function that performs two main tasks:

1. It clears the current draft stored in the storage manager by setting the value of the 'draft' key to null using `storageManager.setValue('draft', null)`.
2. It opens the Dev Docs application by calling the `openDevDocs` function and passing an option `{ useOldToken: true }`.

## Why should I use this code?
This code can be useful in scenarios where you want to clear any existing draft content and open the Dev Docs application with a specific token (in this case, the old token). This can be helpful when you need to start fresh or switch between different authentication tokens for the Dev Docs application.

## What are relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?
While the provided code does not directly reference any configuration options from the `dev-docs.json` file, it is likely that the `openDevDocs` function may rely on certain configuration options defined in that file. Some relevant options could include:

- Authentication tokens or credentials
- API endpoints or URLs
- Environment settings (e.g., staging, production)

## Example JSON of relevant `dev-docs.json` options
```json
{
  "authentication": {
    "oldToken": "xyz123...",
    "newToken": "abc456..."
  },
  "endpoints": {
    "devDocs": "https://dev-docs.example.com/api"
  },
  "environment": "production"
}
```

## Prerequisites
To use this code, you may need the following:

1. An instance of the `storageManager` object, which likely handles storage operations for the extension.
2. The `openDevDocs` function, which is responsible for opening the Dev Docs application and may require additional dependencies or configurations.

## How do I use this code?
To use this code, you would typically call the async function within the appropriate context of your Visual Studio Code extension. For example:

```typescript
import { storageManager, openDevDocs } from './utilities';

// Inside an event handler or command
async function handleCommand() {
  await storageManager.setValue('draft', null);
  await openDevDocs({ useOldToken: true });
}
```

This code assumes that the `storageManager` and `openDevDocs` functions are imported from a separate utility module. When executed, it will clear the current draft and open the Dev Docs application using the old authentication token.
