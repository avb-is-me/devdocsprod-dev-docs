## What does this VS Code Extension Command do?

The `devdocs.showSearchResults` command in the provided code allows users to search for specific content within the documentation files (`.md` files) present in the `dev-docs` directory of their project. When triggered, the command prompts the user to enter a search query and then performs a full-text search across all the `.md` files, excluding the `reference.md` file(s). The search results are then displayed within VS Code, providing easy access to the relevant documentation sections.

## Why should I use this VS Code Extension Command?

This command is particularly useful when working on large codebases with extensive documentation. It allows developers to quickly find information related to specific topics, classes, methods, or concepts without having to manually browse through multiple files. By enabling efficient searching within the documentation, this command can significantly improve productivity and make it easier to understand and navigate the codebase.

## What are relevant configuration Options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The provided code does not explicitly mention any configuration options in a `dev-docs.json` file. However, based on the code, it appears that the extension relies on the presence of a `dev-docs` directory within the project's root directory, where the documentation files are stored. The configuration options could potentially include the location of this directory or any specific settings related to the search functionality, such as file exclusions or search preferences.

## Example JSON of relevant Dev-Docs.json options

Since the code does not provide any specific details about the `dev-docs.json` configuration file, it is difficult to provide an example. However, here's a hypothetical example of what the configuration file might look like:

```json
{
  "documentationDirectory": "path/to/dev-docs",
  "excludedFiles": [
    "reference.md"
  ],
  "searchOptions": {
    "includeSubdirectories": true,
    "ignoreCase": true
  }
}
```

In this example, the `documentationDirectory` option specifies the path to the `dev-docs` directory, `excludedFiles` lists the files to be excluded from the search, and `searchOptions` contains settings related to the search functionality, such as including subdirectories and ignoring case sensitivity.

## Prerequisites

To use the `devdocs.showSearchResults` command, the following prerequisites must be met:

1. The project must have a `dev-docs` directory (or a directory specified in the configuration) containing the documentation files (`.md` files).
2. The VS Code extension that provides this command must be installed and enabled.
3. The project must be opened in VS Code, and the workspace must be properly configured.

## How do I use this VS Code Extension Command?

To use the `devdocs.showSearchResults` command, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in VS Code.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) to open the Command Palette.
3. Type "Dev-Docs Search" or the exact command name (`devdocs.showSearchResults`) and select it from the list of commands.
4. When prompted, enter the search query you want to use to find relevant documentation.
5. The extension will perform a full-text search across the documentation files and display the search results within VS Code.
6. Navigate through the search results to find the relevant documentation sections, and click on the result to open the corresponding file and navigate to the section.

By using this command, developers can quickly access the documentation they need, reducing the time spent searching for information and improving overall productivity.
