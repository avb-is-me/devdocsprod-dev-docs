## What does this command do?
This command initiates the process of signing in to the Dev Docs extension using your GitHub account. It calls the `signInWithGithub` function, which likely handles the authentication flow with GitHub's OAuth mechanism. Upon successful authentication, it sets the `loggedIn` context in Visual Studio Code to `"yes"`, indicating that the user is now logged in.

## Why should I use this command?
Using this command allows you to authenticate with the Dev Docs extension using your GitHub account. This authentication process may be necessary to access certain features or functionalities provided by the extension that require user authentication or authorization. By signing in, you can unlock additional capabilities or personalized experiences within the extension.

## What are relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?
The code snippet provided does not directly reference any configuration options from the `dev-docs.json` file. However, it is possible that the `signInWithGithub` function or other parts of the extension may rely on certain configuration options related to GitHub authentication, such as client ID, client secret, or other OAuth-related settings.

## Example JSON of relevant Dev-Docs.json options
Since the code snippet does not directly reference any configuration options, there is no clear example JSON to provide. However, if the extension requires GitHub authentication settings, the `dev-docs.json` file might contain something like:

```json
{
  "githubAuth": {
    "clientId": "your-github-client-id",
    "clientSecret": "your-github-client-secret"
  }
}
```

## Prerequisites
Before using this command, make sure you have a GitHub account set up and configured. Additionally, the Dev Docs extension may require certain permissions or scopes to be granted during the authentication process.

## How do I use this command?
To use this command, follow these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio Code and ensure that the Dev Docs extension is installed and enabled.
2. Locate the command in the command palette (typically accessed by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and search for "Sign In with GitHub" or a similar command name.
3. Select the command from the list to initiate the authentication flow.
4. Follow the prompts provided by the extension to authenticate with your GitHub account. This may involve opening a browser window or providing your GitHub credentials.
5. Upon successful authentication, the extension will set the `loggedIn` context to `"yes"`, indicating that you are now signed in and can access authenticated features or functionalities.

Note that the specific steps or user interface may vary depending on the implementation details of the Dev Docs extension and the authentication flow used by the extension developers.
