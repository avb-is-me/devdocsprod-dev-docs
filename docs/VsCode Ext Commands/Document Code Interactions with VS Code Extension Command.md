## What does this VS Code Extension Command do?

This VS Code extension command allows you to interact with your codebase and documentation simultaneously. It provides a way to reference existing objects or resources in your codebase and associate them with specific actions or operations. The command prompts you to select an object from a list of available objects in your project, and then choose an action or operation related to that object. After selecting these options, it retrieves the relevant code snippet from your active editor and associates it with the chosen object and action.

## Why should I use this VS Code Extension Command?

Using this VS Code extension command can be beneficial in several ways:

1. **Documentation Integration**: It helps integrate your documentation directly with your codebase, making it easier to maintain and update your documentation as your code changes.

2. **Code Referencing**: By allowing you to reference specific objects and actions in your code, it creates a direct link between your documentation and the actual implementation, improving code comprehension and maintainability.

3. **Contextual Documentation**: The command provides a way to document code snippets in the context of the objects and actions they relate to, making it easier to understand the purpose and usage of the code.

4. **Efficiency**: Instead of manually updating documentation or creating separate code examples, this command streamlines the process by automatically capturing relevant code snippets and associating them with the appropriate documentation.

## What are relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The `dev-docs.json` file likely contains configuration options related to the documentation integration and server communication. Some potential relevant options might include:

- `defaultServerUrl`: The URL of the server where the documentation is stored or retrieved from.
- `defaultOrg`: The default organization or project to associate the documentation with.
- `devdocs_id_token`: An authentication token or API key for securely communicating with the documentation server.

## Example JSON of relevant `dev-docs.json` options

```json
{
  "defaultServerUrl": "https://example.com/api",
  "defaultOrg": "myproject",
  "devdocs_id_token": "abcd1234efgh5678"
}
```

## Prerequisites

To use this VS Code extension command effectively, you may need the following prerequisites:

- An active VS Code editor window with a file open and code selected.
- A configured `dev-docs.json` file with the necessary options for server communication and authentication.
- A list of available objects or resources in your codebase, which may be retrieved from a server or generated based on your project structure.

## How do I use this VS Code Extension Command?

To use this VS Code extension command, follow these steps:

1. Open a file in your VS Code editor and select the relevant code snippet you want to document.
2. Trigger the command by navigating to the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) and searching for the appropriate command.
3. When prompted, select the object or resource from the list that you want to associate with the code snippet.
4. Next, choose the action or operation that the selected code snippet performs on the chosen object.
5. The extension will then communicate with the documentation server, retrieve any existing documentation for the file, and associate the selected code snippet with the chosen object and action.
6. If necessary, the extension may prompt you to provide additional information or confirm the updates to the documentation.

By following this process, you can effectively document code snippets within the context of the objects and actions they relate to, making your documentation more accurate, up-to-date, and easier to maintain.
