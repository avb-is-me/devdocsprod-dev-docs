## What does this code do?

This code defines an asynchronous arrow function that takes a `vscode.Uri` resource as input. It is designed to open a folder specified by the provided resource URI in the DevDocs application. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. It tries to clear any existing draft value stored in the storage manager.
2. It retrieves the DevDocs ID token from the storage manager.
3. It checks if the provided resource URI corresponds to a directory (folder) path.
4. If the path is a directory, it calls the `openDevDocs` function with the folder path and the information that the function was invoked from a folder.
5. If any error occurs during the process, it throws the error.

## Why should I use this code?

This code provides a convenient way to open a local folder directly in the DevDocs application from within Visual Studio Code. This can be particularly useful for developers who are working on projects that involve documentation and want to quickly view or edit the documentation for a specific folder or project.

## What are relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?

While the provided code does not directly reference any configuration options from the `dev-docs.json` file, it is likely that the `openDevDocs` function and the storage manager utilize some configuration options defined in this file. However, without further context or access to the complete codebase, it is difficult to specify which options are relevant.

## Example JSON of relevant Dev-Docs.json options

As mentioned above, without access to the complete codebase, it is not possible to provide an example JSON of relevant configuration options. However, based on the code provided, we can speculate that the `dev-docs.json` file might contain options related to authentication (e.g., the DevDocs ID token) and possibly options for configuring the behavior of the `openDevDocs` function.

## Prerequisites

To use this code, the following prerequisites must be met:

1. The code is part of a Visual Studio Code extension.
2. The DevDocs application is installed and configured correctly.
3. The user has the necessary permissions to access and open folders in the DevDocs application.

## How do I use this code?

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Install the Visual Studio Code extension that includes this code.
2. Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the folder you want to open in DevDocs.
3. Right-click on the folder in the Explorer panel or use the command palette to invoke the "Open Folder in DevDocs" command.
4. The folder should open in the DevDocs application, allowing you to view or edit the documentation for that folder.

It's important to note that the specific usage steps may vary depending on how the extension is implemented and integrated into Visual Studio Code.
