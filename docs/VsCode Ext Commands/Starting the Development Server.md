## What does this command do?

This command creates a new terminal instance within Visual Studio Code and executes the `npm run start -- --host 0.0.0.0` command. This command likely starts a development server for the current project, making it accessible from any device on the local network.

## Why should I use this command?

Using this command can be beneficial in the following scenarios:

1. **Streamlined Development Workflow**: Instead of manually opening a terminal and typing the command, this extension automates the process, allowing you to start the development server with a single click or keyboard shortcut.

2. **Network Accessibility**: By specifying the `--host 0.0.0.0` option, the development server becomes accessible from other devices on the same network. This can be useful for testing on multiple devices or sharing your work with others during development.

3. **Integrated Experience**: Having the development server running within Visual Studio Code's integrated terminal keeps everything within the same environment, reducing context switching and providing a more cohesive development experience.

## What are relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?

There are no relevant configuration options mentioned in the provided code snippet. However, if this extension reads configuration from a `dev-docs.json` file, potential options could include:

- `developmentServerCommand`: The command to execute for starting the development server (e.g., `npm run start`).
- `developmentServerArgs`: Additional arguments to pass to the development server command (e.g., `--host 0.0.0.0`).
- `terminalName`: The name to give to the new terminal instance (e.g., `My Custom Terminal`).

## Example JSON of relevant `dev-docs.json` options

```json
{
  "developmentServerCommand": "npm run start",
  "developmentServerArgs": "--host 0.0.0.0",
  "terminalName": "My Custom Terminal"
}
```

## Prerequisites

Before using this command, ensure that:

1. Your project has a valid `npm run start` script defined in the `package.json` file.
2. The necessary dependencies and development dependencies are installed (typically by running `npm install`).

## How do I use this command?

To use this command, follow these steps:

1. Open your project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Look for the command in the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) or the extension's menu/toolbar.
3. Execute the command to create a new terminal instance and start the development server.
4. The terminal will display the output from the development server, and you can access your application by navigating to the appropriate URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or `http://your-ip-address:port`).

By using this command, you can efficiently start your development server without leaving the Visual Studio Code environment, making the development process more streamlined and convenient.
