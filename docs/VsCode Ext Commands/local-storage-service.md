## What does this code do?

This code defines an asynchronous arrow function that creates a new instance of the `LocalStorageService` class, passing in the `workspaceState` object from the VS Code extension context. The `LocalStorageService` class is likely responsible for managing data storage and retrieval using the browser's local storage mechanism.

## Why would you use this code?

This code is used to create a service that allows you to store and retrieve data locally within the context of the VS Code extension. Local storage is a client-side storage mechanism that allows you to store data in the browser or the VS Code application itself. This can be useful for caching data, persisting user preferences, or storing application state between sessions.

## What are the relevant configuration options?

There are no explicit configuration options mentioned in the provided code snippet. However, the `LocalStorageService` class may have its own configuration options or methods that determine how data is stored and retrieved from local storage.

## Example usage

```typescript
async function getStorageService() {
  const context = vscode.extensions.getExtension('your-extension-id').extensionContext;
  const storageService = await (async () => {
    let testStorageManager = new LocalStorageService(context.workspaceState);
    return testStorageManager;
  })();

  // Use the storageService to store or retrieve data
  storageService.storeData('key', 'value');
  const value = storageService.getData('key');
}
```

## Prerequisites

To use this code, you need to have the following prerequisites:

1. A VS Code extension context object, which is typically provided by the extension's `activate` function.
2. The `LocalStorageService` class or module imported or defined in your extension.

## How do I use this code?

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Import or define the `LocalStorageService` class in your extension.
2. Obtain the VS Code extension context object, typically from the `activate` function.
3. Call the asynchronous arrow function, passing in the extension context's `workspaceState` object.
4. The function will return a new instance of the `LocalStorageService` class, which you can use to store and retrieve data from local storage.

Example usage:

```typescript
import * as vscode from 'vscode';
import { LocalStorageService } from './local-storage.service';

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
  const getStorageService = async () => {
    const storageService = new LocalStorageService(context.workspaceState);
    return storageService;
  };

  const storageService = await getStorageService();

  // Use the storageService to store or retrieve data
  storageService.storeData('key', 'value');
  const value = storageService.getData('key');
}
```

Make sure to handle any errors or additional logic as required by your extension's functionality.
