## What does this VS Code Extension Command do?

This command allows you to extract symbols (variables, functions, classes, etc.) from the currently open file or a specified file in your workspace. It creates a `test-symbols.json` file in the root of your workspace, containing an array of the identified symbols along with their relevant information, such as name, type, code snippet, and documentation (if available).

## Why should I use this VS Code Extension Command?

This command can be useful for various purposes, such as:

1. **Documentation Generation**: By extracting symbols and their associated information, you can use this data to generate comprehensive documentation for your codebase automatically.

2. **Code Analysis**: The extracted symbols can be analyzed to understand the structure and organization of your codebase, identify potential issues, or gather insights for refactoring or optimization.

3. **Testing and Verification**: The `test-symbols.json` file can be used as a reference for testing purposes, allowing you to verify that the extracted symbols match your expectations or to compare them against other sources.

4. **Code Exploration**: By examining the extracted symbols and their details, developers can quickly familiarize themselves with a new codebase or explore specific parts of an existing codebase more efficiently.

## What are relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The `dev-docs.json` file located in your workspace's root directory can contain configuration options related to this command. Relevant options may include:

- `quickDoc.variablesAndFunctions.prompts`: An array of objects defining prompts or questions to be included in the `test-symbols.json` file for each extracted symbol. This can be useful for generating documentation or gathering additional information about the symbols.

- `excludedExpressions`: An array of regular expressions or strings used to filter out symbols that match certain patterns, allowing you to exclude specific symbols from being included in the `test-symbols.json` file.

## Example JSON of relevant `dev-docs.json` options

```json
{
  "quickDoc": {
    "variablesAndFunctions": {
      "prompts": [
        {
          "question": "What does this function do?",
          "title": "Function Description"
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the input parameters and their roles?",
          "title": "Input Parameters"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "excludedExpressions": [
    "/_helper/",
    "/__tests__/"
  ]
}
```

## Prerequisites

To use this command effectively, you should have:

1. A Visual Studio Code workspace with at least one file containing code symbols (variables, functions, classes, etc.).
2. The `dev-docs.json` file in your workspace's root directory (if you want to use any custom configuration options).

## How do I use this VS Code Extension Command?

1. Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to your workspace.
2. Open the file you want to extract symbols from, or have an existing file open.
3. Open the Command Palette in Visual Studio Code (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).
4. Search for the command "Write Symbols to Test File" and select it.
5. If prompted, choose the file you want to extract symbols from (or leave it as the currently open file).
6. After a few moments, a `test-symbols.json` file will be created in the root of your workspace, containing the extracted symbols and their associated information.
7. You can open the `test-symbols.json` file to inspect the extracted symbols or use them for further processing or analysis.

By executing this command, you gain access to a structured representation of the symbols in your codebase, which can be leveraged for various purposes, such as documentation generation, code analysis, testing, or exploration.
