## What does this code do?
This code is responsible for finding and indexing all Markdown files (`.md`) within a specified directory and its subdirectories. It creates an in-memory database using the `dext` library, which allows efficient searching and retrieval of file contents.

## Why should I use this code?
By indexing Markdown files, this code enables efficient searching and retrieval of content across multiple files. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where you need to search for specific information within a large codebase or documentation repository. Additionally, by storing the file contents in an in-memory database, this code provides faster search performance compared to parsing files on-the-fly.

## Relevant configuration options
This code does not rely on any specific configuration options from a `dev-docs.json` file.

## Prerequisites
To run this code, you'll need to have the following prerequisites:

1. **Node.js and npm**: This code is written in TypeScript and requires Node.js and npm to be installed on your machine.
2. **dext library**: The `dext` library is used for creating and managing the in-memory database. You'll need to install it using npm or another package manager.
3. **Access to the file system**: This code reads and indexes files from the file system, so you'll need to have the appropriate permissions to access the target directory and its subdirectories.

## How does this code work?
Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

1. The code first checks if a workspace folder is open in Visual Studio Code. If not, it returns early.
2. It then retrieves the workspace folder path and creates an in-memory database using the `dext` library with a predefined schema.
3. The `findMdFiles` function is called, which recursively searches for Markdown files (`.md`) within the `dev-docs` directory and its subdirectories.
4. For each Markdown file found, the file path and contents are read and inserted into a separate database called `DevDocDb`.
5. Finally, a search is performed on the `DevDocDb` database using the term "pants" as an example. The search results are stored in the `searchResult` variable.

The `findMdFiles` function is responsible for recursively traversing the `dev-docs` directory and its subdirectories to find Markdown files. It uses the `opendir` function from the Node.js `fs/promises` module to open the directory and iterate over its entries. If a directory entry is a directory, it recursively calls `findMdFiles` on that subdirectory. If the entry is a Markdown file (`.md`), it reads the file contents and returns an object containing the file path and content.

This code demonstrates how to efficiently index and search Markdown files within a project or codebase using an in-memory database. By indexing the file contents, searches can be performed quickly without having to parse and read files on-the-fly. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where you need to search for specific information within a large documentation repository or codebase.
