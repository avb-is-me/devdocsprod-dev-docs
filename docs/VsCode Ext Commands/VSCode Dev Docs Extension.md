# **VSCode Dev Docs Extension**

## What does this VSCode Extension Command do?

This VSCode extension command allows you to automatically generate and update documentation for your codebase. It reads the code files and dev-docs.json configuration file in your workspace, and uses that information to create or modify markdown documentation files.

## Why should I use this VSCode Extension Command?

Keeping documentation up-to-date with changes in your codebase can be tedious and time-consuming. This extension automates that process, ensuring your documentation always reflects the current state of your code. It saves you time and effort, while also improving the quality and consistency of your documentation.

## What are relevant configuration Options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The `dev-docs.json` file contains configuration options that control how the extension generates documentation. Some relevant options include:

- `ai`: Settings related to the AI model used for generating documentation
- `mappings`: Specifies which code files should be included, which documentation files to update, and any custom prompts

## Example JSON of relevant Dev-Docs.json options

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "url": "https://your-ai-server.com",
    "mappings": [
      {
        "doc": "README.md",
        "files": ["src/main.ts", "src/utils.ts"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Prerequisites

- Have a `dev-docs.json` file in your workspace root
- Code files you want to document

## How do I use this VSCode Extension Command?

1. Open the Command Palette in VSCode (Ctrl+Shift+P)
2. Search for and run the "Dev Docs: Update from Mappings" command
3. The extension will read your `dev-docs.json`, analyze your code, and update/generate the specified documentation files
4. The updated documentation will be opened for you to review

Some key functionality included:

- **Reading code files**: It can read and extract relevant information, functions, classes etc. from your TypeScript/JavaScript code files.

- **Updating documentation**: It will modify an existing markdown documentation file to add/update sections based on the code.

- **Generating new documentation**: If no documentation file exists, it can generate a new markdown file.

- **AI-assistance**: It leverages an AI model to analyze your code and generate human-readable documentation descriptions.

The configuration in `dev-docs.json` allows you to customize which files are included, mapping code to documentation files, and more.
