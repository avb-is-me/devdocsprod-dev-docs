## What does this code do?

This code sets the base URL for the application to `http://localhost:3000`. It is an asynchronous function that is likely called during the initialization or configuration process of the application.

## Why should I use this code?

The base URL is a crucial configuration setting for many web applications. It defines the root URL that the application will use to make requests to the server or API. By setting the base URL explicitly, you can ensure that the application is pointing to the correct server or API endpoint, which is essential for proper functionality.

If you are developing or running the application locally, setting the base URL to `http://localhost:3000` is a common practice, as it points to the local development server running on port 3000.

## What are relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?

Based on the provided code snippet, there are no specific configuration options mentioned for the `dev-docs.json` file. However, it is common for applications to have a configuration file (such as `dev-docs.json`) that allows developers to manage various settings and preferences.

In this case, the `dev-docs.json` file might contain a section or key-value pair for configuring the base URL, like:

```json
{
  "baseUrl": "http://localhost:3000"
}
```

## Example JSON of relevant Dev-Docs.json options

Here's an example of how the `baseUrl` configuration option might look in the `dev-docs.json` file:

```json
{
  "baseUrl": "http://localhost:3000"
}
```

## Prerequisites

To use this code, you would typically need:

1. A web application or project that requires a base URL configuration.
2. Access to the configuration file or storage mechanism where the base URL is set (e.g., `dev-docs.json` or a centralized storage manager).

## How do I use this code?

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have a centralized storage manager or configuration file (e.g., `dev-docs.json`) where you can store and retrieve the base URL.
2. Locate the initialization or configuration process of your application where the base URL needs to be set.
3. Call the provided asynchronous function, passing in the desired base URL as a parameter.
4. Use the stored base URL value throughout your application whenever you need to construct URLs or make requests to the server or API.

Example usage:

```typescript
import storageManager from './storageManager';

async function initializeApp() {
  await storageManager.setValue('baseUrl', 'http://localhost:3000');
  // Rest of the initialization logic...
}

initializeApp();
```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your application is configured with the correct base URL, which is essential for proper communication with the server or API.
