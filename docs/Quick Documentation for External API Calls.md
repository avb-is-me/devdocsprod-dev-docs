## What does this do?
This code snippet is part of a larger configuration file for a documentation generation tool. It defines a section called "quickDoc" which contains information about variables and functions that should be documented. Specifically, it includes a prompt that asks whether the code being documented makes external API calls.

## Why should I use this?
This configuration is useful because it helps ensure that important information about external API calls is included in the generated documentation. Making external API calls can have implications for performance, security, and other aspects of an application, so it's important to document this behavior.

## Prerequisites
To use this configuration, you'll need to have the documentation generation tool set up and configured correctly. You may also need to have access to the codebase being documented, as the tool will likely need to analyze the code to determine if it makes external API calls.

## How to use this
1. Open the configuration file (likely named something like `dev-docs.json`) for the documentation generation tool.
2. Locate the `quickDoc` section, which should contain the `variablesAndFunctions` object.
3. Under `variablesAndFunctions`, you should find the `prompts` array. This is where the prompt for external API calls is defined.
4. You can modify the `question` and `title` properties of the prompt object to customize the wording and title of the prompt.
5. If you want to add additional prompts or remove the existing prompt, you can modify the `prompts` array accordingly.
6. Save the configuration file and run the documentation generation tool. It should now include information about whether the codebase makes external API calls in the generated documentation.

It's important to note that this configuration is just a small part of a larger documentation generation tool. The tool likely has many other features and configurations that can be used to customize the generated documentation further.
