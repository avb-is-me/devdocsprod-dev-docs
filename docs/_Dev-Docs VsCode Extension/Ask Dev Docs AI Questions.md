The `devdocs.askDocs` command allows you to ask questions about your codebase and get answers generated by an AI model. This feature leverages the power of natural language processing and machine learning to provide you with relevant information and explanations based on the context of your code.

## What does this Vs Code Extension Command do?

The `devdocs.askDocs` command opens an input box where you can enter your question related to the codebase. Once you submit the question, the extension sends a request to the Dev Docs AI service, which analyzes the context of your code and generates a relevant answer. The answer is then displayed as an informational message in Visual Studio Code.

## Why should I use this Vs Code Extension Command?

Using the `devdocs.askDocs` command can be beneficial in several ways:

1. **Quick and Convenient Code Understanding**: Instead of manually searching through documentation or code files, you can simply ask a question and get an AI-generated response tailored to your specific query and codebase context.

2. **Improved Productivity**: By quickly getting answers to your questions, you can save time and avoid context-switching, allowing you to stay focused on your coding tasks.

3. **Enhanced Learning**: The AI-generated explanations can help you better understand the codebase, its structure, and its functionality, which can be especially useful when working with unfamiliar or complex codebases.

4. **Accessibility**: The natural language interface makes it easier to ask questions, especially for those who may find navigating through code and documentation challenging.

## What are relevant configuration Options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The `dev-docs.json` configuration file allows you to customize various aspects of the Dev Docs extension, including the AI-related features. The relevant configuration options for the `devdocs.askDocs` command are:

- `ai.variablesAndFunctions`: This object contains prompts and documentation for variables and functions in your codebase.
- `ai.components.template`: The path to a Markdown file that serves as a template for the AI-generated documentation.
- `ai.docPath`: The custom path where the AI-generated documentation will be stored.

## Example JSON of relevant Dev-Docs.json options

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "variablesAndFunctions": {
      "myFunction": {
        "prompts": [
          {
            "title": "What does myFunction do?",
            "question": "Explain the purpose and functionality of the myFunction.",
            "documentation": "myFunction is a utility function that performs..."
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    "components": {
      "template": "docs/ai-template.md"
    },
    "docPath": "docs/ai-generated"
  }
}
```
