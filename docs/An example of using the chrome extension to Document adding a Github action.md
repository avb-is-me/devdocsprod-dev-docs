## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure to install the "Document This" Chrome extension from the following link: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jdfpljfedojaigjibfnnobbmgmlfkibb](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jdfpljfedojaigjibfnnobbmgmlfkibb)

This extension will allow you to capture screenshots and generate markdown documentation as you navigate through the process of adding a GitHub Action.

## Step 1: Navigate to the Actions Tab

1. Open the repository you want to add a GitHub Action to in your web browser.
2. Navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory by visiting the following URL: `https://github.com/team-dev-docs/devdocs-dev-docs/tree/main/.github/workflows`
3. Find the link with the text "Actions" and click it.

## Step 3: Configure the Workflow

1. On the "Configure GitHub Actions" page (`https://github.com/team-dev-docs/devdocs-dev-docs/actions/new`), find the template you want to use for your GitHub Action. In this example, we'll use the "JavaScript with Node.js" template.
2. Locate the "Configure" button for the selected template and click it.
