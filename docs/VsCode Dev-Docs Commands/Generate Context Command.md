# Generate Context

The "Generate Context" command in the Dev-Docs VS Code extension is designed to generate a high-level context or overview for a specific file or folder in your project. This context can be used as a starting point for writing documentation or providing an introduction to the code in question.

## What does this VS Code Extension Command do?

The "Generate Context" command analyzes the code in the currently open file or selected folder and uses an AI model to generate a concise, human-readable summary that explains the purpose, functionality, and relevant details of the code. This context aims to provide a high-level understanding of the code without delving into the nitty-gritty details.

## Why should I use this VS Code Extension Command?

Writing comprehensive documentation for a codebase can be a time-consuming and challenging task, especially when dealing with complex or unfamiliar code. By leveraging the "Generate Context" command, you can quickly obtain a succinct overview of the code, which can serve as a starting point for further documentation efforts. This can save you time and effort while ensuring that your documentation is accurate and relevant.

## What are relevant configuration Options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The following configuration options in the `dev-docs.json` file are relevant for the "Generate Context" command:

- `ai.contextDirs`: An array of directory paths that should be considered when generating context. By default, it includes `["src/utils", "src/helpers"]`.
- `ai.internalTypeFilters`: An array of TypeScript language constructs (e.g., `"class"`, `"interface"`, `"function"`) that should be included or excluded when generating context.
- `ai.codeFilters`: An array of strings that can be used to filter the code snippets included in the generated context.
- `ai.nameFilters`: An array of strings that can be used to filter code elements based on their names.

## Example JSON of relevant Dev-Docs.json options

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "contextDirs": ["src/utils", "src/helpers", "src/components"],
    "internalTypeFilters": ["class", "interface", "function"],
    "codeFilters": ["export default", "import"],
    "nameFilters": ["handleSubmit", "render", "useState"]
  }
}
```

## Prerequisites

To use the "Generate Context" command effectively, you should have the Dev-Docs extension installed and configured in your VS Code environment. Additionally, ensure that your project adheres to standard coding practices and follows a consistent structure, as this will help the AI model better understand and analyze your codebase.

## How do I use this VS Code Extension Command?

To generate context for a file or folder, follow these steps:

1. Open the file or folder in VS Code for which you want to generate context.
2. Open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS).
3. Search for "Generate Context" and select the command from the list.
4. If prompted, choose whether to generate context for the current file or folder.
5. Wait for the AI model to analyze your code and generate the context.
6. The generated context will be displayed in a new tab or pane within VS Code.

Once you have the generated context, you can review and edit it as needed to ensure accuracy and completeness. It is recommended to treat the generated context as a starting point and enhance it with your own knowledge and understanding of the codebase.

By following these steps and leveraging the "Generate Context" command, you can streamline your documentation efforts and ensure that your documentation remains up-to-date and relevant, making it easier for developers to understand and work with your codebase.
