## What does this VS Code Extension Command do?

This VS Code extension provides a set of commands that allow you to generate comprehensive documentation for your codebase directly within the IDE. The primary command, `devdocs.generateDocumentation`, analyzes your code and automatically creates documentation files for various components, such as functions, classes, and modules. This documentation can be customized and enhanced using the extension's configuration options and other related commands.

## Why should I use this VS Code Extension Command?

Maintaining up-to-date documentation for a codebase can be a time-consuming and tedious task, especially as the codebase grows larger and more complex. This extension automates the process of generating documentation, saving you time and effort while ensuring that your documentation remains consistent with your code. Additionally, having detailed documentation readily available within your development environment can improve code comprehension, onboarding new team members, and collaborating on projects.

## What are relevant configuration Options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The `dev-docs.json` file allows you to customize the behavior and output of the documentation generation process. Here are some relevant configuration options:

- `ai.variablesAndFunctions`: Specifies prompts and documentation for variables and functions.
- `ai.components.template`: Path to a custom Markdown template for generated documentation.
- `ai.docPath`: Custom path for storing generated documentation files.
- `ai.internalTypeFilters`: Filters for including or excluding specific types of code elements in the documentation.
- `ai.codeFilters`: Regular expressions to filter code elements based on their content.
- `ai.nameFilters`: Filters for including or excluding code elements based on their names.
- `ai.populateDoc`: Path to a template file for populating external documentation.
- `ai.docSubFolder`: Subfolder within the documentation directory for storing generated files.
- `ai.contextDirs`: Directories to consider when generating contextual documentation.
- `ai.mappings`: Mappings between code files/folders and their corresponding documentation sections.
- `ai.openapi.file`: Path to an OpenAPI specification file for generating API documentation.
- `ai.openapi.x-codeSamples.langs`: Programming languages for which to generate code samples in the API documentation.

## Example JSON of relevant Dev-Docs.json options

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "variablesAndFunctions": {
      "myFunction": {
        "prompts": [
          {
            "title": "What does myFunction do?",
            "question": "Explain the purpose and functionality of the myFunction function.",
            "documentation": "myFunction is a utility function that..."
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    "docPath": "docs/generated",
    "internalTypeFilters": ["function", "class", "interface"],
    "codeFilters": ["export"],
    "nameFilters": ["utils", "helpers"],
    "populateDoc": "docs/templates/external.md",
    "docSubFolder": "api-reference",
    "openapi": {
      "file": "src/api/openapi.yaml",
      "x-codeSamples": {
        "langs": ["javascript", "python"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Prerequisites

Before using the `devdocs.generateDocumentation` command, ensure that you have configured the extension properly by setting up the `dev-docs.json` file in your project's root directory. Additionally, make sure that your codebase follows best practices and consistent naming conventions to ensure accurate and reliable documentation generation.

## How do I use this VS Code Extension Command?

1. Open the Command Palette in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
2. Search for and select the "Generate Documentation" command (`devdocs.generateDocumentation`).
3. The extension will analyze your codebase and generate documentation files based on your configuration settings.
4. The generated documentation files will be stored in the location specified by the `ai.docPath` and `ai.docSubFolder` configuration options.

You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Shift+Cmd+D` (macOS) or `Shift+Ctrl+D` (Windows/Linux) to quickly generate documentation from within the editor.

Additionally, the extension provides several other commands for managing and enhancing the generated documentation, such as `devdocs.generateExternalDocs` for populating external documentation templates, `devdocs.aiOutlineForCurrentFile` for generating an outline for the current file, and `devdocs.addReference` for adding references to external documentation.

By leveraging this VS Code extension, you can streamline the documentation process, keep your documentation up-to-date, and improve the overall maintainability and collaboration within your projects.
