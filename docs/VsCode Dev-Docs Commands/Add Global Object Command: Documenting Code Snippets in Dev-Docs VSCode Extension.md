The "Add Global Object" command is a feature provided by the Dev-Docs Visual Studio Code (VSCode) extension that allows you to document and associate code snippets with specific global objects and actions within your codebase. This command can be particularly useful when working with large codebases, where it's essential to have proper documentation for various components, functions, and their intended behavior.

## What does this VSCode Extension Command do?

The "Add Global Object" command opens a series of prompts that guide you through the process of documenting a code snippet within the context of a global object and a specific action. It typically involves the following steps:

1. **Selecting the Global Object**: You will be presented with a list of global objects (e.g., classes, modules, or components) that exist within your project. You can choose the relevant global object to associate with the code snippet.

2. **Specifying the Action**: After selecting the global object, you will be prompted to choose an action that the code snippet performs. The actions can range from "create," "update," "delete," "get," "list," or any other relevant operation related to the global object.

3. **Providing the Code Snippet**: Finally, you will be asked to provide the code snippet that you want to document. This can be a selection from your current editor or a new code snippet that you can enter.

Once you have provided the necessary information, the Dev-Docs extension will associate the code snippet with the specified global object and action, making it easier to reference and understand the purpose of that code within the larger context of your project.

## Why should I use this VSCode Extension Command?

Using the "Add Global Object" command can offer several benefits:

1. **Improved Code Documentation**: By documenting code snippets in the context of global objects and actions, you create a more structured and organized approach to code documentation, making it easier for developers to understand the purpose and functionality of different components within the codebase.

2. **Enhanced Code Discoverability**: When code snippets are associated with global objects and actions, it becomes easier to search and navigate through the documentation, especially in large codebases where finding relevant information can be challenging.

3. **Collaborative Development**: Well-documented code snippets associated with global objects and actions can facilitate collaboration among team members, as it provides a shared understanding of the codebase and its components.

4. **Code Maintenance and Refactoring**: Proper documentation can simplify code maintenance and refactoring tasks, as developers can quickly identify the impact of changes on different parts of the codebase.

## What are relevant configuration Options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The `dev-docs.json` configuration file allows you to customize various aspects of the Dev-Docs extension. The relevant configuration options for the "Add Global Object" command are:

- `ai.variablesAndFunctions`: This section defines prompts and documentation for different functions and variables within your codebase. You can specify the prompts and associated documentation for each function or variable, which can be used by the "Add Global Object" command.

- `ai.components`: This section allows you to configure the template file used for generating documentation.

- `ai.internalTypeFilters`: This option determines the types of code elements (e.g., classes, functions, variables) that the extension should consider when generating documentation.

## Example JSON of relevant Dev-Docs.json options

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "variablesAndFunctions": {
      "myGlobalObject": {
        "prompts": [
          {
            "title": "Create myGlobalObject",
            "question": "What is the purpose of this code snippet?",
            "documentation": "This code snippet creates a new instance of the myGlobalObject class with the provided parameters."
          },
          {
            "title": "Update myGlobalObject",
            "question": "What changes does this code make to an existing myGlobalObject instance?",
            "documentation": "This code updates the properties of an existing myGlobalObject instance based on the provided data."
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    "components": {
      "template": "docs/component-template.md"
    },
    "internalTypeFilters": ["class", "function"]
  }
}
```

In this example, the `ai.variablesAndFunctions` section defines prompts and documentation for the "myGlobalObject" class, with specific prompts for creating and updating instances of this class. The `ai.components.template` option specifies the path to the template file used for generating documentation, and the `ai.internalTypeFilters` option limits the documentation generation to classes and functions.

## Prerequisites

Before using the "Add Global Object" command, make sure you have:

1. Installed the Dev-Docs VSCode extension.
2. Configured the `dev-docs.json` file with relevant settings, such as the default organization and server URL.
3. Authenticated with the Dev-Docs service by following the authentication process provided by the extension.

## How do I use this VSCode Extension Command?

To use the "Add Global Object" command, follow these steps:

1. Open a file in the VSCode editor and select the code snippet you want to document.
2. Right-click on the selected code snippet or navigate to the VSCode command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and search for "Add Global Object."
3. Upon running the command, you will be prompted to select the relevant global object from a list of available options.
4. After selecting the global object, you will be asked to choose the action that the code snippet performs (e.g., create, update, delete, get, etc.).
5. Finally, you may be prompted to provide additional information or confirm the code snippet you want to document.

The Dev-Docs extension will then associate the code snippet with the specified global object and action, making it easier to reference and understand within the larger context of your project. The documentation will be stored and can be accessed through the extension's documentation viewer or other features provided by Dev-Docs.

By following these steps and consistently documenting code snippets using the "Add Global Object" command, you can improve the overall quality and maintainability of your codebase, facilitating collaboration and future development efforts.
