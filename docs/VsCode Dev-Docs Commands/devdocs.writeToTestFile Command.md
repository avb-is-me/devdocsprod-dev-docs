This command is used for testing purposes within the Dev-Docs extension. It allows developers to write symbols and other information to a test file named `test-symbols.json` in the workspace root directory.

## What does this Vs Code Extension Command do?

The `devdocs.writeToTestFile` command performs the following actions:

1. It retrieves the active text editor instance from the Visual Studio Code window.
2. It calls the `SymbolHandler` function, passing the active editor instance, the workspace, and an empty object as arguments. This function likely retrieves symbols or other relevant information from the active file or project.
3. If no workspace folders are open, it exits without further action.
4. It determines the file system path of the first workspace folder.
5. It constructs the path for the `test-symbols.json` file by joining the workspace folder path with the filename.
6. It writes the symbols retrieved by `SymbolHandler` to the `test-symbols.json` file in JSON format.

## Why should I use this Vs Code Extension Command?

This command is primarily intended for developers working on the Dev-Docs extension itself. It provides a convenient way to test the `SymbolHandler` function and verify that it is correctly extracting and processing symbols or other information from the active file or project.

For end-users of the Dev-Docs extension, this command is likely not directly useful, as it is designed for internal testing purposes during the development and debugging of the extension.

## What are relevant configuration Options in the `dev-docs.json`?

This command does not appear to be directly influenced by any configuration options in the `dev-docs.json` file. It is a self-contained testing utility that operates based on the active editor and workspace state.

## Example JSON of relevant Dev-Docs.json options

Since this command does not rely on any configuration options, there are no relevant examples to provide.

## Prerequisites

To use this command, you must have the Dev-Docs extension installed and a workspace folder open in Visual Studio Code.

## How do I use this Vs Code Extension Command?

As an end-user, you would typically not need to use this command directly. However, if you want to invoke it for testing or debugging purposes, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Command Palette in Visual Studio Code (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
2. Search for the "Used for testing" command and select it.
3. The command will execute, and if successful, it will write the symbols or information extracted from the active file or project to the `test-symbols.json` file in the workspace root directory.

It's important to note that this command is primarily intended for use by the Dev-Docs extension developers during the development and testing process. As an end-user, you should focus on the main functionality of the extension, such as generating documentation or integrating with external services, rather than using this testing utility directly.
