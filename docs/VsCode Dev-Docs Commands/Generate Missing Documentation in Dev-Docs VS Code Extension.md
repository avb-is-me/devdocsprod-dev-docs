# Generate Missing Documentation

The "Generate Missing Docs" command is a part of the Dev-Docs Visual Studio Code extension, which enables developers to create and maintain comprehensive documentation for their codebase directly within the IDE.

## What does this VS Code Extension Command do?

The "Generate Missing Docs" command allows you to identify and generate documentation for any code elements (e.g., functions, classes, modules) that are currently missing documentation within your project. It leverages the power of AI to analyze your codebase, detect undocumented sections, and automatically generate high-quality documentation for those missing parts.

## Why should I use this VS Code Extension Command?

Maintaining up-to-date and comprehensive documentation is crucial for the long-term maintainability and collaboration within a project. However, manually documenting every aspect of a codebase can be a time-consuming and tedious process. The "Generate Missing Docs" command streamlines this process by automating the documentation generation for undocumented code elements, saving you valuable time and effort.

## What are relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The following configuration options in the `dev-docs.json` file are relevant to the "Generate Missing Docs" command:

- `ai.internalTypeFilters`: An array of strings specifying the types of code elements (e.g., functions, classes, modules) for which you want to generate documentation.
- `ai.codeFilters`: An array of strings used to filter code elements based on specific patterns or keywords.
- `ai.nameFilters`: An array of strings used to filter code elements based on their names.
- `ai.docPath`: The path where the generated documentation files will be saved.
- `ai.docSubFolder`: The subfolder within the `docPath` where the generated documentation will be stored.

## Example JSON of relevant `dev-docs.json` options

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "internalTypeFilters": ["function", "class"],
    "codeFilters": ["export"],
    "nameFilters": ["handleSubmit", "render"],
    "docPath": "docs",
    "docSubFolder": "generated"
  }
}
```

In this example, the "Generate Missing Docs" command will generate documentation for exported functions and classes within your codebase, excluding those named "handleSubmit" or "render". The generated documentation files will be saved in the "docs/generated" directory.

## Prerequisites

Before using the "Generate Missing Docs" command, ensure that you have:

1. Installed and configured the Dev-Docs Visual Studio Code extension.
2. Set up the necessary configuration options in the `dev-docs.json` file according to your project's requirements.

## How do I use this VS Code Extension Command?

To use the "Generate Missing Docs" command, follow these steps:

1. Open the Command Palette in Visual Studio Code (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
2. Search for "Generate Missing Docs" and select the command from the list.
3. Wait for the extension to analyze your codebase and generate documentation for the missing parts.
4. Once the process is complete, you will find the generated documentation files in the specified `docPath` and `docSubFolder`.

The generated documentation will provide a comprehensive overview of each undocumented code element, including its purpose, parameters, return values, and usage examples. This documentation can be further customized and enhanced as needed, but it serves as a solid starting point, saving you valuable time and effort.

By regularly running the "Generate Missing Docs" command, you can ensure that your codebase remains well-documented, facilitating easier onboarding for new team members, better collaboration, and improved maintainability in the long run.
