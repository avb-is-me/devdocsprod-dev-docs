The command `devdocs.fileDocumentFromExplorer` allows you to open the documentation for a specific file within your project. Similarly, the command `devdocs.folderDocument` enables you to create documentation for the current folder you have open in the explorer.

## What does this Vs Code Extension Command do?

The `devdocs.fileDocumentFromExplorer` command generates documentation for a selected file, providing detailed information about its contents, such as functions, classes, and variables. This documentation can help you better understand the file's purpose and how to use its components effectively.

The `devdocs.folderDocument` command, on the other hand, creates documentation for an entire folder. It provides a high-level overview of the folder's contents, including its files and their purposes. This can be particularly useful when working on larger projects or when you need to familiarize yourself with a specific section of the codebase.

## Why should I use this Vs Code Extension Command?

These commands streamline the documentation process, making it easier to generate and access documentation for specific files or folders within your project. By having comprehensive documentation readily available, you can:

1. **Improve Code Understanding**: Documentation helps you quickly grasp the purpose and functionality of files or folders, reducing the time spent trying to understand the codebase.
2. **Enhance Collaboration**: Well-documented code facilitates better collaboration among team members, as it provides a shared understanding of the codebase's structure and components.
3. **Simplify Onboarding**: Detailed documentation can significantly ease the onboarding process for new team members, allowing them to quickly familiarize themselves with the project's structure and codebase.
4. **Maintain Code Quality**: Regularly generating documentation encourages you to keep your code clean and well-organized, promoting better code quality and maintainability.

## What are relevant configuration Options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The following configuration options in the `dev-docs.json` file are relevant for these commands:

- `customRoot`: Specifies the root directory for your project, allowing the extension to generate documentation relative to this path.
- `workspaceRoot`: Defines the absolute path to your project's workspace, which can be helpful when working with multiple projects or repositories.
- `docSubFolder`: Determines the subfolder where the generated documentation will be stored, allowing you to organize your documentation in a structured manner.
- `contextDirs`: An array of directories that the extension should consider when generating context-aware documentation.
- `mappings`: Allows you to map specific files or folders to their corresponding documentation sections in the cloud, enabling better organization and navigation of your documentation.

## Example JSON of relevant Dev-Docs.json options

```json
{
  "customRoot": "packages/my-package",
  "workspaceRoot": "/path/to/project",
  "docSubFolder": "api-reference",
  "contextDirs": ["src/utils", "src/helpers"],
  "mappings": [
    {
      "files": ["src/main.ts"],
      "cloudDir": "Getting Started"
    },
    {
      "folder": ["src/components"],
      "cloudDir": "Components"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Prerequisites

Before using these commands, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. The Dev-Docs extension is installed and activated in your Visual Studio Code environment.
2. You have a `dev-docs.json` configuration file set up in your project's root directory, containing the relevant options mentioned above.
3. If you plan to save your documentation to the Dev-Docs Cloud, make sure you have authenticated with your GitHub account using the `devdocs.getGitHubUser` command.

## How do I use this Vs Code Extension Command?

1. Open your project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Navigate to the Explorer panel and right-click on the file or folder for which you want to generate documentation.
3. From the context menu, select either "Open Doc for File" (`devdocs.fileDocumentFromExplorer`) or "Create Document for current folder" (`devdocs.folderDocument`), depending on your needs.
4. The extension will generate the documentation based on the selected file or folder, taking into account the configuration options specified in your `dev-docs.json` file.
5. Once the documentation is generated, it will open in a new editor tab, allowing you to review and edit it as needed.

By using these commands, you can efficiently generate comprehensive documentation for specific files or folders within your project, improving code understanding, collaboration, and overall project maintainability.
