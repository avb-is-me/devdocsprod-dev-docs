## What does this VS Code Extension Command do?

This VS Code extension command allows developers to easily document their code within the VS Code editor. It provides a user-friendly interface to select the object (class, function, etc.) and the action (create, update, delete, etc.) related to the selected code snippet. The extension then generates documentation for the selected code, including the object type, action, and the actual code snippet.

## Why should I use this VS Code Extension Command?

Documenting code is crucial for maintaining clarity, readability, and collaboration within a project. This VS Code extension streamlines the documentation process by eliminating the need to manually copy and paste code snippets into a separate documentation file or tool. It also ensures that the documentation stays up-to-date with the latest changes in the codebase, as the documentation is generated directly from the code.

## What are relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The `dev-docs.json` file likely contains configuration options for this VS Code extension, such as:

1. **Server URL**: The URL of the server where the documentation is stored or generated.
2. **Default Organization**: The default organization or project to associate the documentation with.
3. **Authentication Token**: A token or API key for authenticating with the documentation server.
4. **File Patterns**: Specifies which files or file types should be included or excluded from the documentation process.

## Prerequisites

Before using this VS Code extension command, ensure that:

1. The `dev-docs.json` configuration file is correctly set up with the appropriate server URL, organization, and authentication token.
2. You have the necessary permissions to create, update, or delete documentation for the selected object and organization.

## How do I use this VS Code Extension Command?

To use this VS Code extension command, follow these steps:

1. Open the file containing the code you want to document in VS Code.
2. Select the code snippet you want to document, or place your cursor within the code block.
3. Trigger the extension command (e.g., through the Command Palette or a keyboard shortcut).
4. A quick pick menu will appear, prompting you to select the object (class, function, etc.) that the selected code belongs to.
5. After selecting the object, another quick pick menu will appear, asking you to choose the action (create, update, delete, etc.) that the code performs on the selected object.
6. The extension will then generate or update the documentation for the selected code, including the object type, action, and the actual code snippet.
7. The documentation will be saved or updated on the configured server, ensuring that it remains synchronized with the latest changes in the codebase.

By following these steps, you can efficiently document your code directly within the VS Code editor, ensuring that the documentation stays up-to-date and accurate.
