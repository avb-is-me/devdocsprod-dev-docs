# **devdocs.generateContext Command**

## What does this command do?

This Visual Studio Code command generates a high-level context or overview of the current code file. It leverages an AI service to analyze the code and provide a helpful summary and documentation.

## Why should I use this command?

Generating context and documentation for code can be a time-consuming and challenging task, especially for large codebases or complex logic. This command automates the process, saving developers time and effort. It can be particularly useful when onboarding new team members or for maintaining comprehensive documentation.

## What are relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The `dev-docs.json` file in the workspace root directory contains configuration options for the extension. Relevant options for this command include:

- `ai.contextPrompt`: A custom prompt or instructions for the AI service when generating the context.
- `ai.editing.onGenerate`: An object containing editing prompts or instructions for the AI service to refine the generated context.

## Prerequisites

To use this command, you need to have the following:

1. The `devdocs` extension installed in Visual Studio Code.
2. A valid `devdocs_id_token` and `devdocs_refresh_token` stored in the extension's storage.
3. A `dev-docs.json` file in the workspace root directory (optional, for custom configuration).

## How do I use this command?

1. Open a code file in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
3. Search for and select the `DevDocs: Generate Context` command.

The extension will analyze the current code file, break it into smaller chunks, and send it to the AI service for generating context and documentation. The generated output will be displayed in a new editor tab or appended to an existing documentation file (if configured).
