## What does this VS Code Extension Command do?

This command allows you to replace the selected text in the currently active editor with AI-generated content. When you trigger this command, it prompts you to enter a new value for the selected text. This value, along with the original selected text, is sent to an AI service, which generates a response based on the provided input. The generated response then replaces the selected text in the editor.

## Why should I use this VS Code Extension Command?

This command can be useful in various scenarios where you need to rephrase, summarize, or expand on the selected text. By leveraging the capabilities of an AI language model, you can quickly generate alternative or enhanced content based on the original selection. This can be particularly helpful when you're working on documentation, code comments, or any other text that requires rephrasing or elaboration.

## What are relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The code provided does not explicitly mention any configuration options in a `dev-docs.json` file. However, it seems to rely on several values stored in the `storageManager`, such as `devdocs_id_token`, `default_org`, and `devdocs_refresh_token`. These values might be configurable through other means, such as settings or environment variables.

## Prerequisites

To use this command, you need to have the following prerequisites:

1. An active text editor with a file open in Visual Studio Code.
2. Selected text in the active editor.
3. Access to an AI service capable of generating content based on the provided input.
4. Necessary authentication tokens or credentials to access the AI service.

## How do I use this VS Code Extension Command?

Here's how you can use this command:

1. Open a file in Visual Studio Code and select the text you want to replace with AI-generated content.
2. Trigger the command by executing the `devdocs.replaceText` command, either through the Command Palette or a keyboard shortcut (if configured).
3. When prompted, enter the new value you want to use as a prompt for the AI service.
4. The command will send the original selected text and the new value to the AI service, and the generated response will replace the selected text in the editor.

Note that this command relies on several helper functions and configurations, such as `callAiService`, `storageManager`, and various authentication tokens and URLs. Make sure these dependencies are properly set up and configured for the command to work as intended.
