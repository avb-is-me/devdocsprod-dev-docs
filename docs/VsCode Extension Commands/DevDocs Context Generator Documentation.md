# **DevDocs Context Generator**

## What does this extension command do?

This Visual Studio Code extension command generates a high-level context or overview for the currently open code file. It analyzes the code, splits it into chunks, and uses an AI model to generate a helpful documentation or explanation of the code's structure, methods, and purpose.

## Why should I use this extension command?

Generating context or documentation for code can be a time-consuming and tedious process, especially for large or complex codebases. This extension automates that process, saving developers time and effort. Additionally, the generated documentation can serve as a starting point for further documentation efforts or as a reference for understanding the code's functionality.

## What are relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The `dev-docs.json` file likely contains configuration options related to the AI model used for generating the context, such as the model's URL, prompts, and editing settings. For example, there may be options to specify custom prompts or editing instructions for different file types or folders.

## Prerequisites

To use this extension command, you'll need:

1. A valid authentication token and organization ID for the AI service being used.
2. The necessary configuration settings in the `dev-docs.json` file.
3. An open code file in Visual Studio Code.

## How do I use this extension command?

1. Open the code file you want to generate context for in Visual Studio Code.
2. Access the command palette (usually by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
3. Search for and select the "Generate Context" command.
4. The extension will analyze the code, split it into chunks, and send it to the AI service for context generation.
5. Once the context is generated, it will be displayed in a new or existing documentation file associated with the code file.

The generated context should provide an overview of the code file's structure, methods, and purpose, helping you quickly understand its functionality without having to read through the entire codebase.
