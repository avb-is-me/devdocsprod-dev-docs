## What does this command do?

This command is responsible for opening the Dev Docs application with relevant information based on the currently open file in Visual Studio Code. It performs the following tasks:

1. Retrieves the active text editor instance from Visual Studio Code.
2. Calls the `SymbolHandler` function to obtain a list of symbols (e.g., classes, methods, properties) that need to be documented for the currently open file.
3. Finds all the files located in the `dev-docs` directory using the `findFilesInDevDocs` function.
4. Creates a list of files that includes the currently open file's URI.
5. Calls the `getUndocumentedFiles` function to identify files that are not yet documented based on the files in the `dev-docs` directory and the list of files created in the previous step.

The primary purpose of this command is to gather information about the currently open file, determine which parts of the code need documentation, and identify any missing documentation files. This information is then passed to the `openDevDocs` function, which is currently commented out in the provided code snippet.

## Why should I use this command?

This command streamlines the process of documenting code within the Dev Docs application. By automating the identification of undocumented code elements and missing documentation files, developers can save time and effort. Additionally, this command ensures that the documentation remains up-to-date and consistent with the codebase, reducing the risk of outdated or inaccurate documentation.

## What are relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The provided code snippet does not directly reference any configuration options from the `dev-docs.json` file. However, it is likely that the `findFilesInDevDocs` and `getUndocumentedFiles` functions might utilize configuration options related to the location of the `dev-docs` directory or the naming conventions for documentation files.

## Prerequisites

To use this command effectively, the following prerequisites should be met:

1. The Dev Docs application should be installed and configured correctly.
2. The codebase should be structured in a way that allows the `SymbolHandler` function to correctly identify symbols that need documentation.
3. The `dev-docs` directory should exist and follow the expected naming conventions for documentation files.

## How do I use this command?

To use this command, follow these steps:

1. Open a file in Visual Studio Code that you want to document or update the documentation for.
2. Open the Visual Studio Code command palette (typically by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
3. Search for and select the "Open Dev Docs" command.

The command will then automatically gather the necessary information about the currently open file, identify any undocumented code elements or missing documentation files, and open the Dev Docs application with the relevant information preloaded.

Note: The provided code snippet has the `openDevDocs` function call commented out, so additional steps might be required to integrate this command with the Dev Docs application.
