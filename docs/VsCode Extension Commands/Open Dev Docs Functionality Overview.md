## What does this code do?

This code is an asynchronous function that performs several tasks related to the "Dev Docs" functionality of the Visual Studio Code extension. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. It clears the value of the 'draft' key in the storage manager, effectively removing any previously saved draft content.
2. It calls the `openDevDocs` function with an empty object as an argument, which likely initiates the process of opening the Dev Docs panel or window.
3. It retrieves the current instance of the `WebAppPanel` (if it exists) and stores its webview in the `webview` variable.
4. Finally, it returns the `webview` object, which can be used for further interactions with the Dev Docs panel or window.

## Why should I use this functionality?

This functionality is useful for developers who want to create and manage documentation within the Visual Studio Code environment. The Dev Docs feature provides a convenient way to write, preview, and publish documentation directly from the code editor. By leveraging this functionality, developers can streamline their documentation workflow and ensure that their code and documentation remain in sync.

## What are relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?

While the code provided does not directly reference the `dev-docs.json` file, it is likely that this file contains configuration options related to the Dev Docs functionality. Some potential configuration options that could be relevant include:

- **quickDoc**: A setting that determines whether the Dev Docs panel should open automatically when a code file is opened or modified.
- **excludedExpressions**: A list of regular expressions or file patterns that specify which files or directories should be excluded from the Dev Docs panel.
- **seperateSave**: A setting that controls whether changes made in the Dev Docs panel should be saved separately from the code files or integrated directly into the code files.

## Prerequisites

To use this functionality, the following prerequisites may be required:

- The Visual Studio Code extension that provides the Dev Docs functionality must be installed and enabled.
- The necessary dependencies and configurations for the Dev Docs feature must be set up correctly.
- The user may need to have appropriate permissions or authentication credentials to access and modify the documentation.

## How do I use this functionality?

To use this functionality, follow these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio Code and ensure that the Dev Docs extension is installed and enabled.
2. Open or create the code file or project for which you want to create or manage documentation.
3. Depending on the configuration settings, the Dev Docs panel may open automatically, or you may need to trigger it manually (e.g., through a command or keyboard shortcut).
4. In the Dev Docs panel, you can create, edit, and preview your documentation content.
5. Once you're satisfied with your changes, you can save the documentation, which may be integrated with your code files or stored separately, depending on the configuration.
6. If needed, you can use the provided functionality to clear any previously saved draft content or perform other actions related to the Dev Docs panel or window.

By following these steps, developers can efficiently create and manage documentation alongside their code, streamlining the development process and ensuring that their documentation remains up-to-date and relevant.
