## What does this VS Code Extension Command do?

This command is responsible for opening the Dev Docs application, which is likely a documentation tool or platform related to the project or codebase. It performs the following actions:

1. It clears the value of the `draft` key in the storage manager.
2. It retrieves the value of the `devdocs_id_token` key from the storage manager, which is likely an authentication token or identifier.
3. It calls the `openDevDocs` function, passing an object with two properties: `openedFrom` (set to `"file"`) and `doctype` (set to `"reference"`).

## Why should I use this VS Code Extension Command?

This command provides a convenient way to access the Dev Docs application directly from within the Visual Studio Code editor. By integrating the documentation platform into the development environment, developers can quickly reference relevant documentation, API references, or other resources without having to switch contexts or applications.

## What are relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?

While the code snippet provided does not explicitly mention any configuration options, it's likely that the `dev-docs.json` file contains settings or configurations related to the Dev Docs application or the VS Code extension itself. Relevant configuration options could include:

- Authentication credentials or tokens
- URLs or endpoints for the Dev Docs application
- Default document types or categories
- Customization options for the documentation viewer or integration

## Prerequisites

To use this VS Code Extension Command effectively, the following prerequisites may be required:

1. The Dev Docs application should be installed and accessible.
2. The necessary authentication tokens or credentials should be configured and available in the storage manager.
3. The VS Code extension associated with this command should be installed and properly configured.

## How do I use this VS Code Extension Command?

To use this VS Code Extension Command, follow these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the project or codebase where the extension is installed.
2. Open the Command Palette in Visual Studio Code (via the menu or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux, or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
3. Start typing "Open Dev Docs" or the command name associated with this functionality.
