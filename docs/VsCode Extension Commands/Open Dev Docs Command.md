## What does this command do?

This command is an asynchronous function that is triggered when a folder is opened in Visual Studio Code. It performs the following tasks:

1. It clears any existing draft content from the `storageManager` by setting the `draft` key to `null`.
2. It retrieves the `devdocs_id_token` from the `storageManager`.
3. It checks if the provided `resource` (which is a URI representing a folder path) is a directory or not. If it's not a directory, it throws an error.
4. If the `resource` is a valid directory, it calls the `openDevDocs` function with an object containing the `openedFrom` property set to `'folder'` and the `folderPath` property set to the file system path of the provided `resource`.

## Why should I use this command?

This command is likely a part of a larger Visual Studio Code extension that integrates with a documentation platform called "Dev Docs." When you open a folder in Visual Studio Code, this command is executed to initiate the process of opening or updating the documentation for that folder within the Dev Docs platform. This can be useful for developers who want to keep their project documentation up-to-date and easily accessible within their development environment.

## What are relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The code snippet provided does not directly reference any configuration options from a `dev-docs.json` file. However, it's likely that the `storageManager` and the `openDevDocs` function rely on certain configuration options defined in a `dev-docs.json` file. Some potential configuration options that might be relevant include:

- Authentication settings (e.g., API keys, access tokens) for the Dev Docs platform.
- Base URLs or endpoints for the Dev Docs API.
- Folder mappings or project configurations to determine which folders should be synced with Dev Docs.
- Formatting or styling preferences for the generated documentation.

## Prerequisites

To use this command effectively, you likely need:

1. A valid installation of the Dev Docs Visual Studio Code extension.
2. A configured `devdocs_id_token` stored in the `storageManager`, which is likely obtained through an authentication process with the Dev Docs platform.
3. A folder or project that you want to integrate with the Dev Docs platform for documentation purposes.

## How do I use this command?

This command is likely triggered automatically when you open a folder in Visual Studio Code, assuming the Dev Docs extension is installed and configured correctly. However, you may also be able to manually trigger this command through the Visual Studio Code command palette or other extension-specific UI elements.

To use this command effectively, follow these steps:

1. Open or create a folder in Visual Studio Code that represents your project or codebase.
2. Ensure that the Dev Docs extension is installed and configured with the appropriate authentication and project settings.
3. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
4. The command should execute automatically, initializing the documentation process with the Dev Docs platform for the opened folder.

If the command is successful, you should see the documentation for your project updated or created within the Dev Docs platform, accessible through the extension's UI or the Dev Docs web interface.
