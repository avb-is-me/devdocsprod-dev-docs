## What is this VSCode Extension Command?

This VSCode extension command is designed to automatically generate documentation for code snippets or entire files. It leverages an AI service to analyze the code and provide concise explanations for variables, functions, and other code elements. The documentation generated includes a summary of what each element is and answers to specific prompts defined in the configuration.

## Why should I use this VSCode Extension Command?

Manually documenting code can be a tedious and time-consuming task, especially for large codebases or frequently changing code. This extension automates the documentation process, saving developers time and effort. Additionally, it ensures that the documentation stays up-to-date with the latest code changes, promoting better code understanding and maintainability.

## What are relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The `dev-docs.json` file contains configuration options that control the behavior of the documentation generation process. Some relevant options include:

1. **ai.internalTypeFilters**: This option specifies the types of code elements (e.g., functions, variables, classes) that should be included in the documentation.
2. **quickDoc.variablesAndFunctions.prompts**: This option allows you to define custom prompts for the AI service to answer regarding specific code elements.
3. **customRoot** and **workspaceRoot**: These options specify the root directories for your codebase, which the extension uses to locate and analyze the relevant files.

## Prerequisites

To use this VSCode extension command, you need:

1. A working installation of Visual Studio Code with the extension installed.
2. Access to an AI service for code analysis and documentation generation (e.g., a hosted service or a locally running AI model).
3. A properly configured `dev-docs.json` file in your workspace or project.

## How do I use this VSCode Extension Command?

1. Open the file or code snippet you want to document in Visual Studio Code.
2. Run the "Generate Documentation" command from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+P on macOS).
3. The extension will analyze the code and generate documentation based on the configuration options in `dev-docs.json`.
4. The generated documentation will be displayed in the editor or saved to a separate file, depending on the extension's settings.

By automatically generating comprehensive and up-to-date documentation, this VSCode extension command streamlines the development process, improves code understanding, and promotes better collaboration within teams.
