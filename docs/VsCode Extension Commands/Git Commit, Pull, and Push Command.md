## What does this VS Code Extension Command do?

This command is designed to streamline the process of committing changes to a Git repository, pulling the latest changes from a remote branch, and pushing the committed changes to the remote branch. It automates the steps of adding all modified files, creating a commit with a timestamp-based message, pulling from the current branch, and finally pushing the committed changes to the same branch.

## Why should I use this VS Code Extension Command?

Using this command can save time and reduce the risk of errors when working with Git repositories. Instead of manually executing multiple Git commands separately, this extension command combines these steps into a single action. It is particularly useful for developers who frequently commit changes to their codebase, as it streamlines the process and ensures consistency in commit messages.
