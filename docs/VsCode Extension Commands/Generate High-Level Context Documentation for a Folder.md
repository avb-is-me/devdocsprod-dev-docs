# **Generating High-Level Context Documentation for a Folder**

## What does this VSCode Extension Command do?

This VSCode Extension command generates high-level context documentation for a folder containing code files. It analyzes all the code files within the selected folder and provides an overview of what the folder's purpose is and what it does from a high level.

## Why should I use this VSCode Extension Command?

This command is useful when you need to quickly understand the purpose and functionality of a folder containing multiple code files. It can help developers, especially newcomers to the codebase, to quickly grasp the high-level context of a folder without having to read through each file individually.

## What are relevant configuration Options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json` file for this command are:

1. `ai`: This object contains configuration settings for the AI service used to generate the high-level context documentation.
2. `customRoot`: This option specifies the custom root directory for your project.
3. `workspaceRoot`: This option specifies the workspace root directory for your project.

## Prerequisites

To use this VSCode Extension command, you need to have the following:

1. A folder containing code files for which you want to generate high-level context documentation.
2. A valid `dev-docs.json` configuration file in your project.
3. Proper authentication credentials (tokens, organization, etc.) to access the AI service used for generating the documentation.

## How do I use this VSCode Extension Command?

To use this command, follow these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the folder for which you want to generate high-level context documentation.
2. Right-click on the folder or open the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) and search for the command "devdocs.generateFolderContext".
3. Select the folder for which you want to generate the documentation.
4. The extension will analyze the code files within the selected folder and generate a high-level context documentation file.
5. The generated documentation will be saved within the selected folder, and a notification will be displayed in Visual Studio Code with the path to the generated file.

The generated documentation will include the following sections:

1. **Header of the Main Code Object or Class**: This section provides a brief description of the main code object or class highlighted in the code files within the folder.
2. **List of Methods with Code Examples**: This section lists all the public methods of the main code object or class, along with code examples for each method.

The documentation aims to provide a clear understanding of the purpose and functionality of the code within the folder, as well as practical examples of how to use the main code object or class.
