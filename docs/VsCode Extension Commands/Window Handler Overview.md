## What does this code do?

This code is an async arrow function that returns the `WindowHandler` object. The `WindowHandler` is likely a class or module responsible for managing the window or user interface of the VS Code extension.

## Why should I use this code?

This code is essential for the proper functioning of the VS Code extension's user interface. The `WindowHandler` object likely provides methods and functionality for creating, managing, and interacting with the extension's window or panel within the VS Code editor.

## What are relevant configuration options?

There are no relevant configuration options mentioned in the provided code snippet. However, the `WindowHandler` class or module may have its own configuration options that can be set in the extension's configuration file or through VS Code settings.

## Prerequisites

To use this code, you would need to have the `WindowHandler` class or module implemented and imported into the `extension.ts` file. Additionally, you would need to have a basic understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript and the VS Code Extension API.

## How do I use this code?

The provided code snippet is a part of the extension's activation function, which is executed when the VS Code extension is activated. The async arrow function is responsible for returning the `WindowHandler` object, which can then be used within the extension to manage the window or user interface.

To use this code, you would typically call or instantiate the `WindowHandler` object within the extension's activation function or other relevant parts of the extension's codebase. The specific usage would depend on the implementation details of the `WindowHandler` class or module.

Here's an example of how you might use the `WindowHandler` object within the extension:

```typescript
import * as vscode from 'vscode';
import { WindowHandler } from './windowHandler';

export async function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
  const windowHandler = await (await import('./extension')).default();
  const panel = windowHandler.createPanel();

  // Use the panel object to interact with the extension's window or UI
  panel.show();
  panel.updateContent('Hello, World!');

  // ...
}
```

In this example, the `WindowHandler` object is obtained from the imported `extension.ts` file, and its `createPanel` method is used to create a new panel (window or UI element) within the VS Code editor. The `panel` object can then be used to show the panel, update its content, and perform other UI-related operations.
