## What does this code do?

This code snippet is an asynchronous arrow function that performs the following tasks:

1. It clears the current draft content stored in the extension's storage by setting the 'draft' key to `null`.
2. It retrieves the DevDocs authentication token (if available) from the storage.
3. It opens the DevDocs application from the 'file' context.

## Why should I use this code?

This code is likely used to manage the draft content and ensure a clean slate before opening the DevDocs application. It also handles the authentication process by checking for an existing token before potentially prompting the user to sign in with their GitHub account (commented out in the provided code).

## What are relevant configuration options?

While there are no explicit configuration options mentioned in this code snippet, the presence of the `storageManager` and `openDevDocs` objects suggests that there might be relevant configuration options related to storage management and DevDocs integration in the `dev-docs.json` file.

## Prerequisites

To use this code, the following prerequisites may be necessary:

1. Access to the `storageManager` module or object for managing extension storage.
2. Access to the `openDevDocs` function or module for opening the DevDocs application.
3. (Potentially) A GitHub account for authentication, if the `signInWithGithub` function is uncommented.

## How do I use this code?

This code is likely invoked as part of a larger workflow or command within the Visual Studio Code extension. Here are the steps to use this code:

1. Ensure that the required dependencies (`storageManager` and `openDevDocs`) are properly imported or defined.
2. Call this asynchronous arrow function when you want to clear the draft content, handle authentication (if necessary), and open the DevDocs application from the 'file' context.
3. If the `signInWithGithub` function is uncommented, be prepared to provide your GitHub credentials for authentication.
4. After executing this code, the DevDocs application should open, and you can proceed with your documentation workflow.

It's important to note that this code snippet is just a small part of the overall extension functionality, and its usage may depend on other components or workflows within the extension.
