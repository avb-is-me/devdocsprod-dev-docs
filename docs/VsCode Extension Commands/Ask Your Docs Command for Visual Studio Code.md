## What does this Vs Code Extension Command do?

The `devdocs.askDocs` command is a Visual Studio Code extension command that allows users to ask questions about their codebase or project documentation. When triggered, it prompts the user to enter a question or prompt related to their project. The extension then leverages a natural language processing (NLP) model to retrieve relevant information from the project's documentation and provide a concise answer to the user's query.

## Why should I use this Vs Code Extension Command?

This command is useful for developers who want to quickly access information from their project's documentation without having to search through multiple files or directories manually. It provides a convenient way to find relevant information by simply asking a question in natural language. This can save time and improve productivity, especially when working on large codebases or projects with extensive documentation.

## What are relevant configuration Options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The code provided does not include any specific configuration options related to the `dev-docs.json` file. However, based on the context, it is likely that this file is used to store configuration settings for the extension, such as authentication tokens, default organization, and other relevant settings.

## Prerequisites

To use this command effectively, you need to have the following prerequisites:

1. A codebase or project with associated documentation files.
2. The documentation files should be in a format supported by the extension (e.g., Markdown, Notion, or other formats specified by the extension).
3. Proper configuration of the extension, including setting up authentication tokens (if required) and specifying the location of the documentation files.

## How do I use this Vs Code Extension Command?

To use the `devdocs.askDocs` command, follow these steps:

1. Open your Visual Studio Code editor with the project or codebase for which you want to access documentation.
2. Press the keyboard shortcut or navigate to the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and search for the `devdocs.askDocs` command.
3. When prompted, enter your question or prompt related to the codebase or project documentation.
4. The extension will process your query, retrieve relevant information from the documentation, and display the answer in a notification or pop-up window.

The command leverages natural language processing capabilities to understand your query and provide a concise answer based on the available documentation. This allows you to quickly find information without having to manually search through files or directories.
