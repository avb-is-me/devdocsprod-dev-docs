## What does this extension command do?

This extension command allows you to manage and create development documentation files within your Visual Studio Code workspace. It provides a quick and convenient way to generate two Markdown files, `general.md` and `reference.md`, inside a `dev-docs` folder at the root of your workspace.

The `general.md` file is intended for general documentation related to your project, while the `reference.md` file is designed to hold technical reference documentation, such as API documentation or code explanations.

## Why should I use this extension command?

Using this extension command can be beneficial for several reasons:

1. **Streamlined Documentation Management**: Instead of manually creating and organizing documentation files, this command automates the process, ensuring consistency and reducing the overhead of setting up a documentation structure.

2. **Centralized Documentation Location**: By placing the documentation files within a dedicated `dev-docs` folder at the workspace root, you can easily access and navigate your project's documentation from a single location.

3. **Improved Organization**: Separating general documentation from technical reference documentation helps maintain a clear structure and makes it easier to find specific information quickly.

4. **Seamless Integration with Visual Studio Code**: As an extension command within Visual Studio Code, this feature integrates seamlessly with your development environment, eliminating the need to switch between different tools or applications for documentation purposes.

## What are relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The code you provided doesn't show any specific configuration options related to the `dev-docs.json` file. However, based on the code, it seems that the extension checks for the following configuration properties:

1. `customRoot`: This property likely specifies a custom root directory for the `dev-docs` folder, overriding the default workspace root.
2. `workspaceRoot`: This property probably represents the default workspace root directory where the `dev-docs` folder should be created if no `customRoot` is specified.

## Prerequisites

To use this extension command effectively, you should have the following prerequisites:

1. Visual Studio Code installed on your machine.
2. A workspace or project opened in Visual Studio Code.
3. The appropriate extension installed and enabled in Visual Studio Code.

## How do I use this extension command?

To use this extension command, follow these steps:

1. Open your Visual Studio Code workspace or project.
2. Look for the extension command in the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) or the corresponding menu or toolbar item.
3. Execute the command by selecting or triggering it.
4. If prompted, choose the desired action (e.g., "yes" or "no") to determine whether the extension should create the documentation files or not.
5. Once the command completes, a `dev-docs` folder will be created at the root of your workspace (or the specified custom root), containing the `general.md` and `reference.md` files.
6. Open and edit these Markdown files to add your project's general documentation and technical reference documentation, respectively.

By following these steps, you can quickly set up a standardized documentation structure within your Visual Studio Code workspace, making it easier to maintain and access your project's documentation alongside your code.
