## What does this code do?

This code is an asynchronous function that clears the value of the 'baseUrl' key from the storage managed by `storageManager`. The `storageManager` is likely a utility or service responsible for handling the storage and retrieval of key-value pairs, possibly in a persistent manner (e.g., browser storage, file system, etc.).

## Why should I use this code?

This code can be useful in scenarios where you want to reset or clear the base URL value stored in the application's storage. This could be necessary when you want to start fresh or when the base URL needs to be reconfigured or updated. By clearing the existing value, you ensure that the application uses the correct base URL for subsequent operations.

## Prerequisites

- An instance of the `storageManager` object or service is available and properly configured.
- The `storageManager` has a `setValue` method that allows setting or updating key-value pairs in the storage.

## How do I use this code?

To use this code, you need to invoke the asynchronous function. Here's an example:

```typescript
// Assuming you have access to the storageManager instance
await clearBaseUrl();
```

This will asynchronously clear the 'baseUrl' value from the storage managed by `storageManager`.

It's important to note that this code snippet is just a small part of a larger codebase, and its usage and context may depend on the specific requirements and implementation details of the application.
