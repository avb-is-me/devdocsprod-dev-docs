High Level

This is an asynchronous function that is part of a Node.js SDK designed to extract unique colors from an image. It can be imported from the `sprite` object after installing the SDK from NPM.

```javascript
import { sprite } from 'sprite';
```

## Why should I use this function?

The `getUniqueColors` function is useful when you need to analyze the color palette of an image. It provides an array of unique color values present in the image, which can be particularly helpful in scenarios such as:

1. **Color Palette Analysis**: Determine the dominant colors in an image, which can aid in various tasks like image processing, color matching, or generating color palettes.
2. **Image Similarity Comparison**: By comparing the unique color sets of two images, you can measure their similarity based on color composition, which can be useful for image deduplication or clustering.
3. **Image Filtering**: Filter or categorize images based on their color profiles, enabling applications like color-based image search or organization.

## What are the parameters or arguments required?

The `getUniqueColors` function accepts two parameters:

1. `imagePath` (required): A string representing the file path or URL of the image to be analyzed.
2. `options` (optional): An object that can be used to pass additional options or configurations to the function. Currently, the code does not define any specific options.

## Prerequisites

To use this function effectively, you'll need:

1. **Node.js**: This function is part of a Node.js SDK, so you'll need to have Node.js installed on your system.
2. **Jimp**: The function relies on the Jimp library for image processing. Ensure that you have Jimp installed and properly configured in your project.

## How do I use this function?

Here's an example of how you can use the `getUniqueColors` function:

```javascript
import { sprite } from 'sprite';

const imagePath = 'path/to/your/image.jpg';

try {
  const uniqueColors = await sprite.getUniqueColors(imagePath);
  console.log('Unique colors:', uniqueColors);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error:', error);
}
```

1. Import the `sprite` object from the installed SDK.
2. Provide the file path or URL of the image you want to analyze as the `imagePath` parameter.
3. Call the `getUniqueColors` function with the `imagePath` and any additional `options` (if needed).
4. The function will return an array of unique color values (represented as integers) present in the image.
5. Handle any potential errors that may occur during the execution of the function.

This function can be particularly useful when you need to analyze or work with the color composition of images in your Node.js applications. It provides a convenient way to extract unique colors, which can be further used for various image processing tasks or color-based operations.
