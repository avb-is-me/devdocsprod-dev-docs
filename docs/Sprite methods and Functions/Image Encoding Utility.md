High Level

The `encodeImage` function is a utility provided by the Sprite Node.js SDK, designed to convert image files into base64-encoded strings. This function can be useful when you need to transmit or store image data within applications or services that require a compact representation of the image.

## Why should I use this function?

The `encodeImage` function simplifies the process of converting image files into base64-encoded strings, which can be particularly useful in the following scenarios:

1. **Web Development**: When you need to embed images directly into HTML or CSS files, using base64-encoded strings can eliminate the need for separate image files and reduce the number of HTTP requests required to load the page.

2. **Data Transmission**: If you need to transmit image data over the network or store it in a database, base64-encoding can provide a compact and efficient representation of the image data, particularly for smaller images.

3. **Data Serialization**: When working with data serialization formats like JSON or XML, base64-encoded strings can be used to represent image data within the serialized data structures.

## What are the required parameters?

The `encodeImage` function takes a single parameter:

- `imagePath` (string): The file path of the image file you want to encode into a base64 string.

## Prerequisites

To use the `encodeImage` function, you need to have the following prerequisites:

1. The Sprite Node.js SDK installed in your project.
2. The `fs` (File System) module from Node.js, which is used internally by the `encodeImage` function to read the image file.

## How do I use this function?

Here's an example of how to use the `encodeImage` function:

```javascript
import { sprite } from 'sprite';

const imagePath = '/path/to/your/image.jpg';
const base64Image = sprite.encodeImage(imagePath);

console.log(base64Image);
// Output: data:image/jpeg;base64,...
```

In this example, replace `/path/to/your/image.jpg` with the actual file path of the image you want to encode. The `encodeImage` function will read the image file and return the base64-encoded string representation of the image data.

Note that the `encodeImage` function assumes that the provided `imagePath` is a valid path to an existing image file. If the file doesn't exist or can't be read, the function will throw an error.
