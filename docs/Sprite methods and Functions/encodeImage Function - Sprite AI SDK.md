High Level

The `encodeImage` function is a utility function provided by the Sprite AI SDK. It allows you to encode an image file into a base64-encoded string representation. This can be useful when you need to transmit or store image data in a compact and efficient manner.

```js
import { sprite } from 'sprite';
```

## Why should I use this function?

You should use the `encodeImage` function when you need to convert an image file into a base64-encoded string representation. This can be beneficial in various scenarios, such as:

1. **Embedding images in web pages**: By encoding an image as a base64 string, you can directly embed it within HTML or CSS code, eliminating the need for separate image file requests.

2. **Transmitting image data over the network**: When sending image data over a network connection, encoding it as a base64 string can be more efficient than transmitting the raw binary data, especially when combined with compression techniques.

3. **Storing image data in databases**: Some databases may have limitations on storing binary data directly. In such cases, encoding the image as a base64 string can be a convenient way to store image data as text.

## What are the parameters or arguments required?

The `encodeImage` function accepts a single argument:

- `imagePath` (string): The file path of the image you want to encode.

## Prerequisites

To use the `encodeImage` function, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Node.js installed**: The Sprite AI SDK is a Node.js package, so you'll need to have Node.js installed on your system.

2. **Sprite AI SDK installed**: You'll need to install the Sprite AI SDK by running `npm install sprite` or `yarn add sprite` in your project directory.

3. **File system access**: Since the `encodeImage` function reads an image file from the file system, ensure that your Node.js process has the necessary permissions to read the specified image file.

## How do I use this function?

To use the `encodeImage` function, follow these steps:

1. Import the `sprite` object from the Sprite AI SDK:

```js
import { sprite } from 'sprite';
```

2. Call the `encodeImage` function and provide the file path of the image you want to encode:

```js
const imagePath = '/path/to/your/image.jpg';
const base64EncodedImage = sprite.encodeImage(imagePath);
```

3. The function will read the image file from the specified path and return a base64-encoded string representation of the image data.

4. You can then use the `base64EncodedImage` string as needed, such as embedding it in an HTML `<img>` tag, transmitting it over the network, or storing it in a database.

Note that the `encodeImage` function assumes that the provided file path is valid and that the image file exists and is accessible. If the file cannot be read or if an error occurs during the encoding process, the function may throw an error.
