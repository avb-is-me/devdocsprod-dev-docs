# **Interface**

## What does this do?
An interface in programming defines a contract or a set of rules that a class or struct must follow. It specifies the properties, methods, and events that the class or struct must implement or provide. Interfaces are used to achieve abstraction and define a common behavior for different types of objects.

## Why should I use this?
Interfaces promote code reusability, extensibility, and modularity. They allow you to define a contract that multiple classes can implement, enabling polymorphism and loosely coupled code. Interfaces also make it easier to swap implementations without modifying the code that uses them, as long as the new implementation adheres to the interface contract.

## Prerequisites
To use interfaces in your code, you need to have a basic understanding of object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes, objects, and inheritance.

## How to use this
In the provided code context, "interface" is a keyword used to define an interface. Here's an example of how you might use an interface:

```
interface IShape {
  area(): number;
  perimeter(): number;
}

class Circle implements IShape {
  radius: number;

  constructor(radius: number) {
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  area(): number {
    return Math.PI * this.radius ** 2;
  }

  perimeter(): number {
    return 2 * Math.PI * this.radius;
  }
}

class Rectangle implements IShape {
  width: number;
  height: number;

  constructor(width: number, height: number) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }

  area(): number {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }

  perimeter(): number {
    return 2 * (this.width + this.height);
  }
}
```

In this example, we define an `IShape` interface that specifies the `area` and `perimeter` methods. The `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes implement this interface, providing their respective implementations of these methods.

The benefit of using interfaces is that you can create a function that accepts any object that implements the `IShape` interface, allowing for polymorphic behavior:

```
function printShapeInfo(shape: IShape) {
  console.log(`Area: ${shape.area()}`);
  console.log(`Perimeter: ${shape.perimeter()}`);
}

const circle = new Circle(5);
const rectangle = new Rectangle(3, 4);

printShapeInfo(circle);
printShapeInfo(rectangle);
```

By defining and adhering to interfaces, you can write more flexible and maintainable code that promotes code reuse and extensibility.
