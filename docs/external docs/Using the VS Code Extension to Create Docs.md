## Use the Editor to Write Docs with Dev-Docs Syntax

To get the full experience of using the Vs Code Editor we recommend using the Dev-Docs markdown syntax so you can use custom styling and custom components that are only available in Dev-Docs' markdown.  To do this we add a Dev-Docs markdown wrapper and then you use the editor.

Which looks like so:

To break it the <code>markdown</code> wrapper is where the extension write all your content, and the <code>parser</code> is a custom component that deals docusaurus to use the Dev-Docs Markdown and rendering.

If you ever forget how to use the Dev-Docs syntax there is a built-in VS Code extension command called <code>Use Dev Docs Syntax</code> that adds that syntax for you. See screenshot below for how to initialize the Dev-Docs Syntax.
