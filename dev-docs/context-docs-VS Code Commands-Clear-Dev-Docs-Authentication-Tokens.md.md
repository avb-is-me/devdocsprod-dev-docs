## Imported Code Object
I apologize, but there seems to be a misunderstanding in your question. The explanation you provided is not a code snippet; it's actually a textual description of what a hypothetical `devdocs.resetTokens` command might do.

There isn't a widely known or standard `devdocs.resetTokens` command in common programming languages or development tools. The description you've provided appears to be explaining the functionality of a custom or specific tool or service called "Dev-Docs."

Without more context about the specific system or tool you're referring to, I can't provide a more accurate explanation. If you have a actual code snippet or more details about the environment where this command is used, I'd be happy to help explain it further.
