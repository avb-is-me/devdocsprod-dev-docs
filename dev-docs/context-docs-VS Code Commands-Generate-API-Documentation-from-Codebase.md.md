This file describes a VS Code extension command called `devdocs.generateAPIDocumentation` that automatically generates API documentation from a codebase. The command analyzes the code to identify API routes and creates two main outputs:

1. A Postman Collection JSON file containing all detected API routes.
2. An OpenAPI (Swagger) specification file for the API.

The document explains the benefits of using this command, including keeping documentation synchronized with code, saving time, improving developer experience, and facilitating testing and collaboration.

It also outlines the relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json` file, prerequisites for using the command, and step-by-step instructions on how to use it within VS Code.

Overall, this file serves as a guide for developers to understand and utilize the automatic API documentation generation feature provided by this VS Code extension.
