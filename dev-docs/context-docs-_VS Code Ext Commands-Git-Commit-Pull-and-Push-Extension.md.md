# High Level Context
## context
This code file describes a VS Code extension command that automates the Git workflow for committing, pulling, and pushing changes. The extension simplifies the process by:

1. Opening a new integrated terminal
2. Creating a timestamped commit message
3. Executing a series of Git commands (add, commit, pull, push)

The file explains the purpose of the extension, its benefits, how to use it, and the prerequisites for its operation. It's designed to streamline the development process by reducing the manual steps involved in version control, particularly useful for frequent documentation updates.

The extension doesn't rely on any external configuration and can be executed through the VS Code Command Palette. It's particularly useful for developers who want to maintain consistent commit messages and quickly synchronize their local changes with a remote repository.
