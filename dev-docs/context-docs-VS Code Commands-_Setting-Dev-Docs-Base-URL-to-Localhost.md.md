This file provides documentation for a Visual Studio Code extension command called "devdocs.setLocal". The command is used to set the base URL for the Dev-Docs extension to "http://localhost:3000", which is useful for developers working with a locally running instance of the Dev-Docs application.

The document explains:
1. What the command does
2. Why it should be used
3. Prerequisites for using the command
4. Step-by-step instructions on how to use the command

It's primarily intended for developers who are working on or testing the Dev-Docs application locally and need to configure their VS Code extension to communicate with this local instance. The document also mentions that while there's no specific configuration option in the dev-docs.json file for this setting, the base URL can be set programmatically using the storageManager API provided by the extension.
