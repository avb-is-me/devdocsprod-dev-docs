## Imported Code Object
The comment "# Turn On Markdown Mode" likely refers to a feature or command in a code editor or development environment that enables a special mode for writing and rendering Markdown content.

When activated, this mode typically:

1. Enhances the editor's ability to recognize and syntax-highlight Markdown formatting.
2. May provide a live preview of the formatted Markdown.
3. Could offer additional tools or shortcuts for common Markdown elements.
4. Might adjust the editor's behavior to better suit writing documentation or comments in Markdown format.

This feature is particularly useful for developers who want to write documentation, comments, or README files using Markdown syntax directly within their code editor, providing a seamless experience for both coding and documentation tasks.
