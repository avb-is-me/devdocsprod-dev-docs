This file describes a Visual Studio Code extension command called "Populate Your External Docs" that automates the generation of API documentation from code. The command analyzes the codebase, identifies relevant symbols (methods, classes, functions), and generates detailed documentation pages for each symbol. These pages are then published to an external location.

Key features of this command include:
1. Configurable through a `dev-docs.json` file
2. Filters for symbol types, code snippets, and symbol names
3. Customizable documentation template
4. Ability to specify the output location within a documentation site

The file explains the purpose of the command, its benefits, configuration options, prerequisites, and step-by-step instructions on how to use it. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining up-to-date documentation and how this tool can save time and effort in the process.
