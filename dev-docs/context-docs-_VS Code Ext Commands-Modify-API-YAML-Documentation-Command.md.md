This Markdown file describes a VS Code extension command called "Modify API YAML Documentation". The command is designed to help developers maintain and update their API documentation in OpenAPI YAML files. Key points include:

1. Purpose: Automates the process of updating specific sections of API route documentation.
2. Functionality: Uses AI to generate updated content for selected documentation sections.
3. Configuration: Relies on settings in a `dev-docs.json` file for AI and OpenAPI configurations.
4. Usage: Accessed through VS Code's command palette, allowing users to select a route and documentation section to update.
5. Benefits: Saves time and effort in keeping API documentation accurate and consistent with code changes.
6. Prerequisites: Requires an OpenAPI YAML file, proper configuration, and a connected AI service.

The command streamlines the documentation process, making it easier for developers to maintain up-to-date API documentation alongside their code.
